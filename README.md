# The Four Rules of Layout

A simple one-page website about the four basic rules of layout design:

1. **Emptiness** – Use empty space to group related elements.
2. **Grid** – Align elements using a consistent grid.
3. **Fonts** – Use no more than three fonts.
4. **Colors** – Stick to a primary and an accent color.

Built as a simple landing page for practicing clean and effective UI design.
